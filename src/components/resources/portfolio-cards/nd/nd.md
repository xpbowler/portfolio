## Background

As a patient develops cancer, their gene expression pattern changes in a characteristic way that can be quantified by sequencing their RNA, yielding a numerical expression value for every gene. Thus, we developed a convolutional neural network able to predict whether a patient’s RNA-seq data is likely to be representative of cancer tissue. This cost-effective, non-invasive diagnosis method aims to increase the success rate of early cancer detection.

## About

The CNN was trained with Tensorflow based on patient RNA-seq data transformed into 2D images suitable for the CNN’s convolutional layer. It contains 2.4M parameters, achieves a 98.7% prediction accuracy, and is able to classify 4 types of cancer: breast, lung, kidney, and uterine cancer. 


## How to use it 

NeuroDetect takes a 2D image transformed from RNA-seq data as the input. Under ```c_images``` the test and train data can be found. Under each category, there are 8 classes of tissue: 

- Breast Normal Tissue (BRCA.N)
- Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA.T)
- Kidney Renal Normal Tissue (KIRC.N)
- Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC.T)
- Lung Normal Tissue (LUAD.N)
- Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD.T)
- Uterine Corpus Endometrial Normal Tissue (UCEC.N)
- Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC.T)

To test out NeuroDetect, input a file from any of the 8 categories under test data, which the CNN has never seen before.
